For 10 days, Red Bull Music Festival was held at different spaces in São Paulo, in a celebration of the music of yesterday, today and the future. Invited by Grupo Oito, producer of the festival, I was responsible for the lighting of five events, from its aesthetic conception to its operation. 
<br />
We created unique light designs in dialogue with each day's proposal, space, and artist, while keeping a cohesive structure along the week. The lighting wasn't only for the stage and dance floors, but also installed throughout the whole space: halls, lounges, bars, windows. It became a core element for the aesthetic of the festival.
