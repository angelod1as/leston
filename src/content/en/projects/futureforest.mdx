title: Future Forest
order: 1300
excerpt: Created by The Force, Future Forest is a led installation in which the space pulses in different colors, shapes and movements, always in sync with the sound.
extraInfo: Future Forest was created as a Heinekein brand activation during DGTL São Paulo festival in 2018.<br /><br />[Video](https://vimeo.com/279746818)

Positioned as a grid, 80 two-meter-tall led bars shape a large space occupied by the audience. The lighting pulses in perfect sync with the music, detecting its rhythms and variations. Gradually, their colors, shapes, and movements transform to follow the sound. A synaesthetic experience is created in an immersion combining the dimensions of the space and the visual representation of sound.
<br />
Invited by The Force, creator of the project, I developed the control software for the whole piece. The first and most fundamental characteristic of its programming is that the piece is not a screen, but space and volume. In being so, the contents created live through sound analysis are tridimensional, exploring not only its height and width, but also depth, simulating the propagation of sound.
<br /><br />
The system is also completely autonomous. When it detects the lack of low frequencies, indicating the preparation of a transition by the DJ, the software also prepares for transformation. When the drop comes, the lights come back on, pulsating differently.
