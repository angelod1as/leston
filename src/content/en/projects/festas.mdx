Besides music, visuals are at the core of constructing a nightlife experience. Increasingly, independent Brazilian parties have focused not only on sound quality, but also their aesthetics. Through lighting it's possible to transform perception completely and the event's whole atmosphere. 

On account of my research focusing on the relation between sound and visuality, I began creating the lighting for different parties, such as Folklore, Masterplano, Glow in the Dark and Caverna. From concept creation to lighting design, to production and operation along the night, I've always departed from two principles: 

First, synaesthesia. Instead of using traditional systems to control the fixtures, I use computers and code in a way that the lighting is perfectly in sync with the sound at all times. In turn, changes in the music create visual changes, and this synaesthetic experience leads to the sound being understood in a different way. 

The second principle is the creation of a visual narrative throughout the night. Instead of one single aesthetic, I make a point to alter between the use of different fixtures, movement and color along the rave, in a way that each moment has its own special characteristic. Therefore, the story told by each DJ within their lineup is followed by a different type of visual matter, creating specific experiences and memories that come together in a greater narrative. \
