The works from the Mono series look like handmade paintings: the gesture and texture of the paint are apparent. But, when closely inspected, it is noticeable that they are digital prints. Those images don't have any handmade aspects and are entirely created with algorithms.

Two simple pictures of black lines on a white background are randomly generated. They are interpreted as one unique, very short video with only two frames. The computer calculates the movement that should have happened between those two shapes, even if they are unrelated. This procedure is repeated a few times with the results of the previous iterations so that this error (trying to calculate something that doesn't exist) gets accumulated.

In this process, the tools are used in unexpected ways. Besides, and most importantly, the organic aspect of the gestures depicted in those pieces comes from the accumulation of mistakes and the superposition of calculation errors.
