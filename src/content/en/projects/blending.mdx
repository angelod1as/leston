Created by Steve Bruno, Blending is a movie about a Lieutenant who recollects the memories of his self-destruction moments before his death. After choosing his successor, he struggles with the instinct of admiration, insecurity, and territoriality caused by the presence of his perfect updated reflection.

Blending mixes different technologies and looks. It was recorded in both 8mm and 16mm movie films, 35mm and 120mm stills, and 3D generated images, which I developed using photogrammetry and LiDAR scanning.

For the photogrammetry, a few specific moments from the story were selected to be enacted and photographed with hundreds of photos from different angles. For a few weeks, I processed these photos to generate 3D objects animated with new illumination, as an instant frozen in time.

For the LiDAR scanning, I developed a technique to record the raw data of a Kinect in small takes that I captured during the shooting. With this process, the final images could be constructed afterward, and it was not necessary to make aesthetic decisions during the enactment. With the raw material, I made a series of point clouds that I animated with the director in different ways for each scene.
