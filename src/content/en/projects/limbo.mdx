Hick Duarte's exhibit Limbo reflects on the emotional state of the young within especially unsettling times in Brazil. Through different media, the artist seeks to observe the suspension in which Brazilian youth finds itself: this generation seems to occupy a place of indefinition and restlessness, overwhelmed by information, where everything is jumbled and the notion of relevance is lost. 

The central piece of the exhibition, the video that lends it its title, unfolded into an installation. I was invited to develop technical solutions for the work, from its physical aspects to the code that controlled its exhibition. Composed of five projections, the work had two different moments: the complete film and the fragmented film. Entirely automated, the software created for Limbo also controlled the spatialized sound, a track developed through four different channels for four speakers, together with a lighting system positioned behind the main screen and synchronized with the film.
