title: Moiré
order: 100
excerpt: Live performance in which two grand pianos, controlled by a computer, transpose  the homonymous visual effect to sound. 
extraInfo: The project was commissioned by curator Lucas Bambozzi for the 2019 edition of the festival On_Off - Live Image Experiences at Itaú Cultural. <br /><br />[Video teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQMdt1qqVMY&ab_channel=MatheusLeston)<br /><br />[Interview about the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmKl-wwLdaw)

Moiré is a very common optical effect in videos and photographs, emerging when two regular patterns, such as parallel lines, grids, or halftones overlap in slightly different positions. The phenomena was a reference for this performance, which utilizes as its main element two acoustic grand pianos controlled by a computer. The same pattern is played slightly dislocated in time by each piano, highlighting both their difference and common structure. And therefore transposing the moiré effect to sound. 
<br />
I also control a modular synth on stage, creating a musical structure over which the pianos play. The lighting of the whole space is programmed to contrast the performance's different moments explicitly.
