Comprising 42 moving lasers, Antitempo is a seven-minute audiovisual piece created by The Force. I was invited to develop a control system, syncing the lasers perfectly with the sound through equations and mathematical patterns - thoroughly complex, although very simple to use. With this software, I created a lighting choreography, building shapes that alter the perception of space, unfolding into a visual narrative.
<br />
I also wrote the soundtrack for the whole piece, developed alongside its control software: at times the lasers follow the song, at others it is the song that follows the lasers. What begins as a sound texture, an unknown environment, builds up and becomes increasingly musical and rhythmic.
