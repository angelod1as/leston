title: Estímulos Emocionais
order: 800
excerpt: Immersive experience by Estudio Guto Requena in which the participants' brain waves and heartbeats create graphs in real-time.
extraInfo: The work was presented in the show "Entre Bits, Átomos e Afetos" (Between Bits, Atoms and Affections), focused on the work of Estudio and exhibited in 2020 at Sesc Sorocaba.<br /> <br />[Video case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJPi4VO6N08)

Six people sit around a large round table in an unlit room, wearing headphones, electroencephalogram and cardiac sensors. Audio narration guides them through a series of controversial questions regarding life situations. The sensor-collected data is transformed into images, which in turn are projected on the table, creating connections between the participants and their stories, developing a collective exercise of empathy. 

I was invited by Estudio Guto Requena, which conceived and produced the project, to create both the code that builds real-time visuals generativelly and the soundtrack of the whole piece. 

The electroencephalogram detects attention and relaxation levels of the six participants, exhibited as a graph on the table. Slowly, the images transform into a single connected shape, moving like a life-full organism, followed by sound. In the final chapter of the experience, the cardiac pulse sensors are activated and the projected shape begins to represent the heartbeats of all participants. The journey ends with their hearts beating together and the phrase "my heart beats as yours does".
