In Mementos, an installation in partnership with Aya, 45 lasers combined create a drawing that cuts through space. Developed parametrically, through calculation, the drawing seems to twist the space, suggesting an organic structure created from straight lines. 

Through hardware developed specifically for the installation, the lasers' intensity can be controlled individually. Therefore, the drawing of the space transforms and reveals itself in different ways: beams can light up quickly and randomly, or in a slow sequence, or all at once. These different patterns are controlled through generative programming: it isn't a preconceived timeline, a choreographed sequence, but an organism that transforms itself infinitely.

The soundtrack is also generative and parametric. It is not a set composition that repeats itself, but in fact a series of musical structures controlled and generated live by the same code that controls the lasers, creating intimate relations between visuality and sound.
