The Nomade Orquestra, a big band from the outskirts of São Paulo, is one of the biggest names in Brazilian Instrumental Music, dabbling in genres such as funk, jazz, dub and afrobeat. 

I started my partnership with the band at the launching concert of the Vox Machina album. The experiments started at the time were brought to life in the audiovisual performance at Sesc Pinheiros. Designed with led panels in different sizes and heights, the scenography creates a scenery for the band. 

The content was developed in partnership with the visual artist Gabriel Rolim and mixes audio-reactive elements (generated through programming with real-time sound analysis) with graphic pieces created analogically through signal generators, televisions,  amongst other vintage equipment. The images are synchronized with the sound during the performance, not only creating scenographic spaces but also bringing forth important musical elements of the compositions.
