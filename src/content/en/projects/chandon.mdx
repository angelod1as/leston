To celebrate its new identity, Casa Chandon (Chandon House) was a month-long event in which the public could come in contact with the brand and its products. Besides pocket shows, brunches and drinks, there were also tasting sessions and technology experiences. 

The space was designed by Estudio Guto Requena and from the start I was part of its conception, from the initial conversations to its final execution. Two experiences were also my responsibility: the Terroir and the Synaesthetic Bar. 

The Synaesthetic Bar was a space in which the public had a tasting experience and learned about the characteristics of the brand's different sparkling wines. People wore neural sensors that captured data and this information was then transformed into colors, shown in a large led screen that embraced and lit the whole space. It was possible, then, to observe the way different wines suggested different responses and sensations in each visitor. Besides participating in the conception of the installation and sketching of the space, I also created the software that generated the real-time images, controlling the whole room through a tablet. 

The Terroir was a video installation which occupied ten walls and the whole floor of a very large room with images from the beverages' creation process. Projectors led the visitor to an immersion in Garibaldi, the city where Chandon is produced in Brazil. There they could follow the whole production process of sparkling wine: from planting and harvesting to tasting. Besides its concept, I was also responsible for the editing of the material and the construction of this visual narrative.
