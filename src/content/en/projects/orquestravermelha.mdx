The Orquestra Vermelha (Red Orchestra) is a band in which I play with shadows of other musicians who are not on stage. Four led screens exhibit the silhouettes of the other six members in real-life size, as if they were in fact present. Simultaneously, I control the videos live while playing with them, becoming a shadow against the light of a fifth screen. 
<br />
The musicians were recorded and filmed improvising at a studio, building on a few simple structures and musical sketches. Each recording was then, successively, edited and presented to the new invited artist. Therefore the tracks were shaped through a complex relation between composition, improvisation and editing.
