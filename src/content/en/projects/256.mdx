excerpt: A generative series of GIFs studying the role of color by creating the illusion of movement through very restrictive rules.
extraInfo: The series is being developed since the end of 2021 and launched as NFT through the Tezos network. <br /><br />[Objkt.com](https://objkt.com/profile/256x256x256x256/created), [Teia](https://teia.art/256x256x256x256)

The title of the series 256x256x256x256 refers to its limitations, its rules: each GIF has a resolution of 256x256 pixels, 256 frames and 256 colors. Correspondingly, each frame has 256 pixels in each of its 256 colors. Through time, each of the pixels fade from one color to another.
<br />
At first glance, this set of rules might seem arbitrary. However, they are the core of the project: all of the GIFs are one and the same in terms of matter, built by the same pixels, changing their color the exact same way. What in fact differs from one animated image to the next is only their positioning - solely responsible for transforming our entire perception of movement and color.
