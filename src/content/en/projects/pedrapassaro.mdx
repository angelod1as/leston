Pedra Pássaro (Stone Bird) is a generative series. That means its images are generated through algorithms and not modeled manually: code controls all aspects of every 3D. Both its geometry and materiality suggest that it can be a mineral (rock, stone) and an animal (bird, muscle) at the same time. Although the rendered images are of a very complex, highly-detailed quality, this convergence (or perhaps collision) between the realms generates implausible scenes, resurfacing as clearly digital: these organic creature-objects are in fact built through a visibly inorganic creation process.
<br />
Because it is a generative process, Pedra Pássaro is also an infinite series. Observing the different outputs of the project, both the peculiarities of each image and the correspondences induced by their governing system become perceivable.
