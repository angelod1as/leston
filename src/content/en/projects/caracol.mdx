Created by the studio Sometimes Always, the visual identity of Caracol bar is based on a simple system: four shapes, nine colors, and seven different ways of combining them.
<br />
I was invited by the studio to solve a huge problem: how could we generate daily images when facing almost 7 billion possible combinations of shape, color and composition? My solution was to create a computer software that could automatically generate variations. Its workings are very simple, the keyboard space bar creates the image, while the enter key exports it in the correct resolution. So Caracol's daily social network publicity became an extremely simple task.
