Bar de Cima was a unique place, built within a glass structure located on the top floors of the restaurant Chez Oscar. Invited by Estudio Orth, I produced the new lighting system for the whole space in partnership with Dmtr.org and Lee Dawkings. 

For the dance floor, we designed a led strip structure that crosses the whole ceiling and goes down the walls, installed into custom-built metal profiles. Through different movement and color programming, these lights create different rhythms and alter the mood of the space. Although a sophisticated system, it is very easy to control: without the need for computers, these led strips communicate with each other through wifi, and pressing one single button is enough to change the lighting presets. 

On the lower floor we used a red digital sign. Though typical within street businesses, in this case it had a length of 14 meters, encapsulating and illuminating the whole space with its texts and images, programmed especially for the space. Other signs were also installed in the elevators leading to the bar.
