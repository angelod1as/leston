excerpt: An Electronic Music project utilizing code and modular synths to play live through improvisation.
extraInfo: I have used this system for raves such as Masterplano, Carlos Capslock's Çala Çatélite and Mamba Negra's Rádio Vírus. Besides, I've also done a series of 3D live presentations from my studio during the pandemic.<br /><br />[Obra](https://www.facebook.com/obratechno/videos/2296998090607507)<br />[Música no Deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5fELWNVa4w)<br />[Trajetórias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NZsxpF069o)

One of my biggest interests in Electronic Music is the way that in certain productions, usually techno-oriented, the harmonic discussion seems secondary. Timbres, textures, sound design, rhythms and effects are highlighted, hence leaving our perception of note, chord and harmony choices in the background. Maybe even making them less important. 

Alongside the many years I've been working, I've developed a series of techniques which allow me to explore these aspects very deeply. Today, my main rig is a modular synth, controlled through code, which I keep working on and improving at all times. With it, I have the possibility of doing completely improvised live performances, in which I don't use pre-programmed tracks or track parts. Everything is generated randomly and in real-time through code. Playing live becomes a dialogue: I respond to what the computer creates while controlling it myself.
