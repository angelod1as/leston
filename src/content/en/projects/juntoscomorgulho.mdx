As part of the LGBTQIA+ pride month, Facebook invited Estudio Guto Requena in partnership with Mutato and Studio Curva to create an installation on a hallmark of the city: the Minhocão. The blind wall of a huge building was painted with the colors of the movement through the participation of the public. 

Those who watched the live stream were invited to contribute in the comments with their stories, using the #JuntosComOrgulho (#TogetherWithPride) hashtag. Through code, these hashtags were counted in real time and exhibited as a "pride-meter". Following the flag's color sequence, when the number of one column reached 100%, the corresponding paints were poured automatically, flowing along the blind wall. Therefore, bit by bit,  the LGBTQIA+ flag was collectively recreated. 

Besides participating in the conceptualization of the piece, I was responsible for part of the code required for the real-time experience. Through Facebook's API, the hashtags were read and sent to the software I developed. After being counted, programming generated the "pride-meter" displayed on the live feed. From the recording studio, signals were sent through the internet to our base at Minhocão, pouring the paints automatically when the value reached 100%.
