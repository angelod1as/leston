title: about

I'm Leston: musician, artist and multimedia developer based in SÃ£o Paulo. Besides my own artistic practice, I also develop interactive, generative and immersive projects for other artists, events and institutions. Through a critical perspective, my practice strains the tensions between art and technology, sound and visuality. Programming is not only viewed as a tool, but the language of the work itself, its own shape and form.
