title: about

I'm Leston: musician, artist and multimedia developer based in São Paulo. Besides my own work, I also develop interactive, generative and immersive projects for other artists, events and institutions. Through a critical perspective, my practice strains the tensions between art and technology, sound and visuality. I don't believe programming is only a tool, but the language of the work itself. That is, its own shape and form. I'm the son of a programmer, learning many self-taught skills from a very young age. I've also studied music since childhood and I'm an audio technician, even though my formal training is in Modern Languages. I've worked in pedagogical teams in cultural institutions, such as the São Paulo Biennial and the Tomie Ohtake Institute. I was the founding member of Bloco, a studio now focused on music and technology, and also the Creative Director of Juntxs, Guto Requena Studios' lab. Nowadays, my own work manifests itself through different languages, although my main interests are in live performances and digital creation.
