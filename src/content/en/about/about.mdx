title: about

I'm Leston: musician, artist and multimedia developer based in SÃ£o Paulo. Besides my own work, I also develop interactive, generative and immersive projects for other artists, events and institutions. Through a critical perspective, my practice strains the tensions between art and technology, sound and visuality. I don't believe programming is only a tool, but the language of the work itself. That is, its own shape and form.
