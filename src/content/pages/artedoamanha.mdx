At the end of last year, I started 256x256x256x256 as a way to study the perception of movement and color. To do that, I created a series of rules: 256x256 grid, 256 shades of color, and 256 frames. Also, every pixel changes color linearly from 1 to 256, and there are 256 pixels in each of the 256 colors in every frame.

Those may sound arbitrary, but they were constructed with a simple but precise goal: the color content of every frame of every piece is the same. The only thing that changes from GIF to GIF is the position of the pixels. Another way to think about it is that every piece is the same, just scrambled. Yet, it seems that the colors change and that the movement is entirely different.

So far, I have released three different batches of the series, each with 16 pieces and different color shades. I'm also constantly updating the code that generates the GIFs, making the patterns more complex at each iteration. In this process, something else captured my interest in this study of the perception of color and movement: dithering. Combining a smaller palette of colors makes it possible to trick the brain into perceiving shades that aren't really there.

Branca Branca is a new chapter in 256x256x256x256. This body of work is a direct continuation of the subject of the series, but it makes it even more complex. The same rules apply, but instead of solid colors, different shades of white are represented by a custom dither algorithm. Although it seems that those pieces are in grayscale, actually, there is no shade of gray at all. The pixels are either entirely black or white. The amount of black versus the number of white pixels makes our brain perceive shades of gray that aren't really there.

In Portuguese, "white" is "branco". "Branca" is the feminine.
 
Unlike the previous batches, all 16 pieces will be minted this Monday, July 4, as a Branca Branca collection on Objkt.com. The first one is a special Collectors Edition, which will be airdropped to the top 16 collectors of the series. As part of the #1of1 event, all the other 15 pieces will be 1/1s. **Please place your offers (above 16 Tez) on the pieces you are interested in. The highest bids will be accepted on Friday, July 7, at the end of the event.**
